This is a React App that is used to detect faces in images. Simply copy and paste an image URL, click detect, and it will locate the face in your image.

Here is an example image for you to copy and paste to try it out: https://express-images.franklymedia.com/6616/sites/265/2018/06/25064539/worm.jpeg

This project uses the Clarifai face detection API to detect the face and then some DOM manipulation to implement the returned coordinates into the box on the face in the image. I've used Tachyons to help with some of the styling, while using react-particles and react-tilt to add some spice to the site.
